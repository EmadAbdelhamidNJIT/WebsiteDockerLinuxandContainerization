            <h2>Linux Basic Commands</h2>
            <p>Before we go on to the list of commands, you need to open the command line first. If you are still unsure
                about the command-line interface, check out this <a
                        href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-cli" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">CLI
                    tutorial</a>.</p>
            <p>Although the steps may differ depending on the distribution that you’re using, you can usually find the
                command line in the <strong>Utilities</strong> section.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of basic Linux commands:</span></p>
            <h3>1. pwd command</h3>
            <p>Use the <strong>pwd</strong> command to find out the path of the current working directory (folder)
                you’re in. The command will return an absolute (full) path, which is basically a path of all the
                directories that starts with a forward slash <strong>(/)</strong>. An example of an absolute path is
                <strong>/home/username</strong>.</p>
            <h3>2. cd command</h3>
            <p>To navigate through the Linux files and directories, use the <strong>cd</strong> command. It requires
                either the full path or the name of the directory, depending on the current working directory that
                you’re in.</p>
            <p>Let’s say you’re in <strong>/home/username/Documents</strong> and you want to go to
                <strong>Photos</strong>, a subdirectory of <strong>Documents</strong>. To do so, simply type the
                following command: <strong>cd</strong> <strong>Photos</strong>.</p>
            <p>Another scenario is if you want to switch to a completely new directory, for example,<strong>/home/username/Movies</strong>.
                In this case, you have to type <strong>cd</strong> followed by the directory’s absolute path: <strong>cd
                    /home/username/Movies</strong>.</p>
            <p>There are some shortcuts to help you navigate quickly:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>cd ..</strong> (with two dots) to move one directory up</li>
                <li><strong>cd </strong>to go straight to the home folder</li>
                <li><strong>cd-</strong> (with a hyphen) to move to your previous directory</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On a side note, Linux’s shell is case sensitive. So, you have to type the name’s directory exactly as it
                is.</p>
            <h3>3. ls command</h3>
            <p>The<strong> ls</strong> command is used to view the contents of a directory. By default, this command
                will display the contents of your current working directory.</p>
            <p>If you want to see the content of other directories, type <strong>ls</strong> and then the directory’s
                path. For example, enter <strong>ls</strong> <strong>/home/username/Documents</strong> to view the
                content of <strong>Documents</strong>.</p>
            <p>There are variations you can use with the <strong>ls</strong> command:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ls -R</strong> will list all the files in the sub-directories as well</li>
                <li><strong>ls -a</strong> will show the hidden files</li>
                <li><strong>ls -al</strong> will list the files and directories with detailed information like the
                    permissions, size, owner, etc.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4. cat command</h3>
            <p><strong>cat</strong> (short for concatenate) is one of the most frequently used commands in Linux. It is
                used to list the contents of a file on the standard output (sdout). To run this command, type <strong>cat</strong>
                followed by the file’s name and its extension. For instance: <strong>cat file.txt</strong>.</p>
            <p>Here are other ways to use the <strong>cat</strong> command:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>cat &gt; filename </b>creates a new file</li>
                <li><b>cat filename1 filename2&gt;filename3 </b>joins two files (1 and 2) and stores the output of them
                    in a new file (3)
                </li>
                <li>to convert a file to upper or lower case use, <strong>cat filename | tr a-z A-Z
                    &gt;output.txt</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>5. cp command</h3>
            <p>Use the <strong>cp</strong> command to copy files from the current directory to a different directory.
                For instance, the command <strong>cp scenery.jpg</strong> <strong>/home/username/Pictures</strong> would
                create a copy of <strong>scenery.jpg</strong> (from your current directory) into the
                <strong>Pictures</strong> directory.</p>
            <h3>6. mv command</h3>
            <p>The primary use of the <strong>mv</strong> command is to move files, although it can also be used to
                rename files.</p>
            <p>The arguments in mv are similar to the cp command. You need to type <strong>mv</strong>, the file’s name,
                and the destination’s directory. For example: <strong>mv file.txt /home/username/Documents</strong>.</p>
            <p>To rename files, the Linux command is <strong>mv oldname.ext newname.ext</strong></p>
            <h3>7. mkdir command</h3>
            <p>Use <strong>mkdir</strong> command to make a new directory — if you type <strong>mkdir Music</strong> it
                will create a directory called <strong>Music</strong>.</p>
            <p>There are extra <strong>mkdir</strong> commands as well:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To generate a new directory inside another directory, use this Linux basic command <strong>mkdir
                    Music/Newfile</strong></li>
                <li>use the&nbsp;<strong>p </strong>(parents) option to create a directory in between two existing
                    directories. For example, <strong>mkdir -p Music/2020/Newfile</strong> will create the new “2020”
                    file.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>8. rmdir command</h3>
            <p>If you need to delete a directory, use the <strong>rmdir</strong> command. However, rmdir only allows you
                to delete empty directories.</p>
            <h3>9. rm command</h3>
            <p>The <strong>rm</strong> command is used to delete directories and the contents within them. If you only
                want to delete the directory — as an alternative to rmdir — use <strong>rm -r</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Be very careful with this command and double-check which directory you are in.
                This will delete everything and there is no undo.</p>
            <h3>10. touch command</h3>
            <p>The <strong>touch</strong> command allows you to create a blank new file through the Linux command line.
                As an example, enter touch <strong>/home/username/Documents/Web.html</strong> to create an HTML file
                entitled <strong>Web</strong> under the <strong>Documents</strong> directory.</p>
            <h3>11. locate command</h3>
            <p>You can use this command to <strong>locate</strong> a file, just like the search command in Windows.
                What’s more, using the <strong>-i</strong> argument along with this command will make it
                case-insensitive, so you can search for a file even if you don’t remember its exact name.</p>
            <p>To search for a file that contains two or more words, use an asterisk <strong>(*)</strong>. For example,
                <strong>locate -i school*note</strong> command will search for any file that contains the word “school”
                and “note”, whether it is uppercase or lowercase.</p>
            <h3>12. find command</h3>
            <p>Similar to the <strong>locate</strong> command, using&nbsp;<strong>find</strong> also searches for files
                and directories. The difference is, you use the <strong>find</strong> command to locate files within a
                given directory.</p>
            <p>As an example, find <strong>/home/ -name notes.txt</strong> command will search for a file called
                <strong>notes.txt</strong> within the home directory and its subdirectories.</p>
            <p>Other variations when using the <strong>find</strong>&nbsp;are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To find files in the current directory use, <strong>find . -name notes.txt</strong></li>
                <li>To look for directories use, <strong>/ -type d -name notes. txt</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>13. grep command</h3>
            <p>Another basic Linux command that is undoubtedly helpful for everyday use is <strong>grep</strong>. It
                lets you search through all the text in a given file.</p>
            <p>To illustrate, <strong>grep blue notepad.txt</strong> will search for the word blue in the notepad file.
                Lines that contain the searched word will be displayed fully.</p>
            <h3>14. sudo command</h3>
            <p>Short for “<strong>SuperUser Do</strong>”, this command enables you to perform tasks that require
                administrative or root permissions. However, it is not advisable to use this command for daily use
                because it might be easy for an error to occur if you did something wrong.</p>
            <h3>15. df command</h3>
            <p>Use <strong>df</strong> command to get a report on the system’s disk space usage, shown in percentage and
                KBs. If you want to see the report in megabytes, type <strong>df -m</strong>.</p>
            <h3>16. du command</h3>
            <p>If you want to check how much space a file or a directory takes, the <strong>du</strong> (Disk Usage)
                command is the answer. However, the disk usage summary will show disk block numbers instead of the usual
                size format. If you want to see it in bytes, kilobytes, and megabytes, add the <strong>-h</strong>
                argument to the command line.</p>
            <h3>17. head command</h3>
            <p>The<strong> head</strong> command is used to view the first lines of any text file. By default, it will
                show the first ten lines, but you can change this number to your liking. For example, if you only want
                to show the first five lines, type <strong>head -n 5 filename.ext</strong>.</p>
            <h3>18. tail command</h3>
            <p>This one has a similar function to the head command, but instead of showing the first lines, the <strong>tail</strong>
                command will display the last ten lines of a text file. For example, <strong>tail -n
                    filename.ext.</strong></p>
            <h3>19. diff command</h3>
            <p>Short for difference, the <strong>diff</strong> command compares the contents of two files line by line.
                After analyzing the files, it will output the lines that do not match. Programmers often use this
                command when they need to make program alterations instead of rewriting the entire source code.</p>
            <p>The simplest form of this command is <strong>diff file1.ext file2.ext</strong></p>
            <h3>20. tar command</h3>
            <p>The <strong>tar</strong> command is the most used command to archive multiple files into a <strong>tarball</strong>
                — a common Linux file format that is similar to zip format, with compression being optional.</p>
            <p>This command is quite complex with a long list of functions such as adding new files into an existing
                archive, listing the content of an archive, extracting the content from an archive, and many more. Check
                out some <a href="https://www.linuxtechi.com/17-tar-command-examples-in-linux/"

                    examples</a> to know more about other functions.</p>
            <h3>21. chmod command</h3>
            <p><strong>chmod</strong> is another Linux command, used to change the read, write, and execute permissions
                of files and directories. As this command is rather complicated, you can read <a
                        href="https://www.computerhope.com/unix/uchmod.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"
                        rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the full tutorial</a> in order to execute it properly.</p>
            <h3>22. chown command</h3>
            <p>In Linux, all files are owned by a specific user. The <strong>chown</strong> command enables you to
                change or transfer the ownership of a file to the specified username. For instance, <strong>chown
                    linuxuser2 file.ext</strong> will make <strong>linuxuser2</strong> as the owner of the <strong>file.ext</strong>.
            </p>
            <h3>23. jobs command</h3>
            <p><strong>jobs</strong> command will display all current jobs along with their statuses. A job is basically
                a process that is started by the shell.</p>
            <h3>24. kill command</h3>
            <p>If you have an unresponsive program, you can terminate it manually by using the <strong>kill</strong>
                command. It will send a certain signal to the misbehaving app and instructs the app to terminate itself.
            </p>
            <p>There is a total of <a href="https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/linux-signals-part-1/"
                                      data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sixty-four
                signals</a> that you can use, but people usually only use two signals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SIGTERM (15)</strong> — requests a program to stop running and gives it some time to save
                    all of its progress. If you don’t specify the signal when entering the kill command, this signal
                    will be used.
                </li>
                <li><strong>SIGKILL (9)</strong> — forces programs to stop immediately. Unsaved progress will be lost.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Besides knowing the signals, you also need to know the process identification number (PID) of the program
                you want to <strong>kill</strong>. If you don’t know the PID, simply run the command <strong>ps
                    ux</strong>.</p>
            <p>After knowing what signal you want to use and the PID of the program, enter the following syntax:</p>
            <p><strong>kill [signal option] PID</strong>.</p>
            <h3>25. ping command</h3>
            <p>Use the <strong>ping</strong> command to check your connectivity status to a server. For example, by
                simply entering <strong>ping google.com</strong>, the command will check whether you’re able to connect
                to Google and also measure the response time.</p>
            <h3>26. wget command</h3>
            <p>The Linux command line is super useful — you can even download files from the internet with the help of
                the <strong>wget</strong> command. To do so, simply type <strong>wget</strong> followed by the download
                link.</p>
            <h3>27. uname command</h3>
            <p>The <strong>uname</strong> command, short for Unix Name, will print detailed information about your Linux
                system like the machine name, operating system, kernel, and so on.</p>
            <h3>28. top command</h3>
            <p>As a terminal equivalent to Task Manager in Windows, the <strong>top</strong> command will display a list
                of running processes and how much CPU each process uses. It’s very useful to monitor system resource
                usage, especially knowing which process needs to be terminated because it consumes too many resources.
            </p>
            <h3>29. history command</h3>
            <p>When you’ve been using Linux for a certain period of time, you’ll quickly notice that you can run
                hundreds of commands every day. As such, running <strong>history</strong> command is particularly useful
                if you want to review the commands you’ve entered before.</p>
            <h3>30. man command</h3>
            <p>Confused about the function of certain Linux commands? Don’t worry, you can easily learn how to use them
                right from Linux’s shell by using the <strong>man</strong> command. For instance, entering <strong>man
                    tail</strong> will show the manual instruction of the tail command.</p>
            <h3>31. echo command</h3>
            <p>This command is used to move some data into a file. For example, if you want to add the text, “Hello, my
                name is John” into a file called name.txt, you would type <strong>echo Hello, my name is John</strong>
                <strong>&gt;&gt; name.txt</strong></p>
            <h3>32. zip, unzip command</h3>
            <p>Use the <strong>zip</strong> command to compress your files into a zip archive, and use the
                <strong>unzip</strong> command to extract the zipped files from a zip archive.</p>
            <h3>33. hostname command</h3>
            <p>If you want to know the name of your host/network simply type <strong>hostname</strong>. Adding a
                <strong>-I</strong> to the end will display the IP address of your network.</p>
