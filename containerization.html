            <div class="heading"><h1>What are containers?</h1></div>
            <p class="content">Containers offer a logical packaging mechanism in which applications can
                be abstracted from the environment in which they actually run. This decoupling allows
                container-based applications to be deployed easily and consistently, regardless of whether
                the target environment is a private data center, the public cloud, or even a developer’s
                personal laptop. Containerization provides a clean separation of concerns, as developers
                focus on their application logic and dependencies, while IT operations teams can focus on
                deployment and management without bothering with application details such as specific
                software versions and configurations specific to the app.
            </p>
            <p class="content">For those coming from virtualized environments, containers are often compared with
                virtual machines (VMs). You might already be familiar with VMs: a guest operating system
                such as Linux or Windows runs on top of a host operating system with virtualized access to
                the underlying hardware. Like virtual machines, containers allow you to package your
                application together with libraries and other dependencies, providing isolated environments
                for running your software services. As you’ll see below however, the similarities end here as
                containers offer a far more lightweight unit for developers and IT Ops teams to work with,
                carrying a myriad of benefits.

                    <div class="heading"><b>Why Containers?</b></div>
                    <p class="content">Instead of virtualizing the hardware stack as with the virtual machines
                        approach, containers virtualize at the operating system level, with multiple containers
                        running atop the OS kernel directly. This means that containers are far more lightweight:
                        they share the OS kernel, start much faster, and use a fraction of the memory compared to
                        booting an entire OS.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">There are many container formats available. Docker is a popular, open-source
                        container format that is supported on Google Cloud Platform and by Google Kubernetes
                        Engine.

                    <p class="content pad-bottom">Containers silo applications from each other unless you explicitly
                        connect them. That means you don't have to worry about conflicting dependencies or resource
                        contention — you set explicit resource limits for each service. Importantly, it's an
                        additional layer of security since your applications aren't running directly on the host
                        operating system.

            <p class="l-space-top-0 content">Containers give developers the ability to create predictable environments
                that are isolated from other applications. Containers can also include software
                dependencies needed by the application, such as specific versions of programming language
                runtimes and other software libraries. From the developer’s perspective, all this is
                guaranteed to be consistent no matter where the application is ultimately deployed. All
                this translates to productivity: developers and IT Ops teams spend less time debugging
                and diagnosing differences in environments, and more time shipping new functionality for
                users. And it means fewer bugs since developers can now make assumptions in dev and test
                environments they can be sure will hold true in production.

            <p class="l-space-top-0 content">Containers are able to run virtually anywhere, greatly easing development
                and deployment: on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems; on virtual machines or bare
                metal; on a developer’s machine or in data centers on-premises; and of course, in the
                public cloud. The widespread popularity of the Docker image
                format</a> for containers further
                helps with portability. Wherever you want to run your software, you can use containers.

            <p class="l-space-top-0 content">Containers virtualize CPU, memory, storage, and network resources at the
                OS-level, providing developers with a sandboxed view of the OS logically isolated from other
                applications.
