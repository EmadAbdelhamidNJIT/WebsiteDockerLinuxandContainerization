                very popular. With PyCharm Professional Edition 5,&nbsp;<a
                        href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2015/10/announcing-pycharm-5-eap-143-165-docker-integration/">Docker
                    is now supported</a>&nbsp;as a remote interpreter.</p>
            <p>Let’s take a look at PyCharm’s Docker integration in action.</p>
            <div id="summary">
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Get a Django-oriented Docker image pulled locally</li>
                    <li>Make a sample Django project</li>
                    <li>Create a Docker interpeter to run it</li>
                    <li>The Django run configuration makes a new container on start and removes it on stop</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="overview">
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>In Python, when you run an application – a Django site, a database script, etc. – you are running it
                    in an environment. Python has some tools to manage the environment and make it reproducible, such as
                    virtual environments, pip&nbsp;<code>requirements.txt</code>&nbsp;files,
                    and&nbsp;<code>setup.py</code>&nbsp;dependencies. But what about the non-Python parts of
                    application?</p>
                <p>Containers are one solution to this. In Docker, a container is an isolated universe with software,
                    running inside your computer. They are fast and easy to create, start, stop, and destroy. This is
                    ideal, not just for development, but for deployment as well.</p>
                <p>PyCharm 5 provides the beginning of a series of steps towards productive development using containers
                    and Docker. Namely, PyCharm 5 supports project interpreters that are executed in a Docker
                    container.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="preparation">
                <h2>Preparation</h2>
                <p>First, make sure&nbsp;<code>docker</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>docker-machine</code>&nbsp;are setup in
                    your environment. The Docker installation is painless and the&nbsp;<a
                            href="https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/">website docs</a>&nbsp;are quite
                    friendly. You’ll need a Docker “host” virtual machine setup and running, including on Linux. On
                    Windows and OS X, installing the Docker Toolbox is effortless.</p>
                <p>Next, we have to decide what software we want in our containers. In Docker, containers are built
                    using “images”: collections of pre-installed software plus configuration that is called during
                    container creation. Unlike other interpreters in PyCharm, you don’t visit the&nbsp;<code>Project&nbsp;Interpreter</code>&nbsp;preferences
                    to add Python packages. All dependencies need to be baked into the Docker image you choose.</p>
                <p>This blog post is based on the “minimum/docker-django-mysite“ Docker&nbsp;image, which includes
                    enough Python/Django software to run the&nbsp;PyCharm-generated Django starter project. You can
                    fetch that onto your&nbsp;system with this command:</p>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <pre>$ docker pull minimum/docker-django-mysite</pre>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Once that Docker image is locally available&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;the Docker “host” is running and
                    knows about it, PyCharm can make Docker interpreters for your project, as containers based on that
                    image.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, you can skip this step and later pull in the image while&nbsp;creating the
                    Docker-based remote interpreter by simply typing in&nbsp;the image name during creation.</p>
                <div>
                    <p><em>Note: You have the option of making your own image as well, using
                        a&nbsp;<code>Dockerfile</code>. Once you make the image, you can tell PyCharm to make Docker
                        interpreters based on it.</em></p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="create-django-project">
                <h2>Create Django Project</h2>
                <p>Let’s make a Django project, then make a Docker interpreter for it. In PyCharm, choose&nbsp;<code>File&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;New&nbsp;Project</code>,
                    click on&nbsp;<code>Django</code>, and follow the normal process for making a Django project.</p>
                <p>During project creation, you’ll have to use a local interpreter. If you try to make a Docker
                    interpreter, PyCharm will give a warning saying you can only use a local interpreter.</p>
                <p>The result of this step is a directory on your local computer with sample Django code and a
                    Django-specific PyCharm Run Configuration.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="make-pycharm-docker-interpreter">
                <h2>Make PyCharm Docker Interpreter</h2>
                <p>On to the important part. We need to define a “remote interpreter” that runs in a PyCharm Docker
                    container.</p>
                <p>First, go to&nbsp;<code>Preferences&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Interpreter</code>&nbsp;and click on
                    the gear to the right of&nbsp;<code>Project&nbsp;Interpreter</code>&nbsp;near the top. In
                    the&nbsp;<code>Configure&nbsp;Remote&nbsp;Python&nbsp;Interpreter</code>dialog, click
                    the&nbsp;<code>Docker</code>&nbsp;button.</p>
                <p>Click the menu dropdown for&nbsp;<code>Machine&nbsp;Name</code>. It will likely have one entry named&nbsp;<code>default</code>.
                    Choose that, and you will see the following:</p>
                <p><a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pycharm-docker_interpreter.png"><img
                        loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3578"
                        src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pycharm-docker_interpreter.png"
                        alt="docker_interpreter" width="661" height="503"></a></p>
                <p>Choosing&nbsp;<code>default</code>&nbsp;gives PyCharm a way to find the Docker daemon, which can let
                    PyCharm know which images are available locally. Hence the dropdown for&nbsp;<code>Images</code>.
                    Click on the dropdown and choose&nbsp;<code>minimum/docker-django-mysite:latest</code>&nbsp;as the
                    image, then click&nbsp;<code>Ok</code>.</p>
                <p>You now have a Docker container that will be used as your project interpreter. PyCharm features like
                    autocompletion, code inspections, and checks will be driven by this interpreter.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="run-django">
                <h2>Run Django</h2>
                <p>Now that we have a Docker container for our project interpreter, let’s use our Django-flavored Run
                    Configuration to run it. Just to be safe, edit the run configuration to make sure it is using the
                    Docker-oriented interpreter.</p>
                <p>What does PyCharm do when it runs this configuration:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, it creates and starts a new container based on the image we named when creating the
                        project interpreter.
                    </li>
                    <li>This container mounts your project directory into the container
                        at&nbsp;<code>/opt/project</code>&nbsp;in the container.&nbsp;<em>Note: On Linux, you currently
                            have to perform this volume mapping manually.</em></li>
                    <li>This container also mounts volumes needed for PyCharm to do its work: Python skeletons and
                        Python library sources.
                    </li>
                    <li>It then executes the run configuration’s Python command.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you are running PyCharm 5.0.2 or older, there is one fix you need to do:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Run -&gt; Edit Configurations and select the PyCharm-generated Djano run configuration</li>
                    <li>In the&nbsp;<code>Host</code>&nbsp;field, enter&nbsp;<code>0.0.0.0</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you click the “Run” button, Django will be started. Yay, we are running a container! In fact, we
                    can go on to test running, debugging, code coverage, profiling, and all the other ways to run a
                    configuration.&nbsp;But first, let’s click the link in the console to open&nbsp;the Django site in
                    our browser:</p>
                <p><a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pycharm-django_admin.png"><img
                        loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3577"
                        src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pycharm-django_admin.png"
                        alt="django_admin" width="756" height="565"></a><br>
                    You can confirm this using the following Docker commands:</p>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <pre>$ docker ps -l</pre>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>This shows the most recently-run container. As you can see, our&nbsp;<code>minimum/docker-django-mysite</code>-based
                    container is currently running.</p>
                <p>Likewise, when you click the “Stop” button in PyCharm to stop the running Django configuration,
                    PyCharm not only stops Django, but it also stops the Docker container. In fact, it deletes the
                    container. Each time you run, PyCharm creates a new Docker container and starts it.</p>
                <p>You can confirm this. After re-starting the Django run configuration, type:</p>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <pre>$ docker ps -l</pre>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The value in the&nbsp;<code>CONTAINER&nbsp;ID</code>&nbsp;column, as well as
                    the&nbsp;<code>NAMES</code>&nbsp;value, is different from the previous values we got from running&nbsp;<code>docker&nbsp;ps&nbsp;-l</code>.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="current-limitations">
                <h2>Current Limitations</h2>
                <p>Docker integration in PyCharm is already useful, but is still only a start. Much more is being done
                    for future releases. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Docker Compose</em>. This is a big item and a frequently-requested feature. The effort for
                        this is tracked in a&nbsp;<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-17573">YouTrack
                            ticket</a>&nbsp;in the PyCharm ticket system and work is already being scheduled. Please
                        vote and leave any comments you might have.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Linux mounts</em>. As noted in the PyCharm online help, on Linux, you have to mount your
                        project directory manually via VirtualBox. This issue is obviated by work on the next point.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Customizing the container</em>. Docker lets you pass arguments when creating/running a
                        container. These arguments include volumes to mount and ports to forward. PyCharm doesn’t
                        currently let you customize this in the run configuration, but this is being worked on.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Only Django for web ports</em>. If you want a container with HTTP (or any other) ports
                        available, the Django run configuration is the only one, and that is only for HTTP. Other run
                        configurations (Flask, Pyramid, etc.) won’t forward any ports. Nor will attaching to a database,
                        or orchestrating multi-container apps (unless your Dockerfile forwards the ports.) This is
                        really just emphasizing the previous point, and as said there, help is on its way.
                    </li>
